# Heart Attack Analysis

This project involves the analysis of heart attack data to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters. The analysis is conducted using Python and various machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. This project aims to analyze data related to heart disease and predict the likelihood of a heart attack. The analysis is done using various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and significant indicators of heart disease.

## Dataset Analysis
In this section, we perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, detect any anomalies, and visualize the data. This includes:
- Summary statistics
- Visualizations (histograms, correlation matrices, etc.)
- Handling missing values

## Data
The dataset contains various health parameters of patients which are used to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. The main features include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trtbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalachh)
- Exercise induced angina (exng)
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak)
- The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slp)
- Number of major vessels (caa)
- Thalassemia (thall)

## Methods
The following methods are used in this project:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data.
- Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features for prediction.
- Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The results section includes:
- Performance metrics of the models
- Visualizations of the model performance
- Insights gained from the analysis

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings of the analysis and discusses the implications of the results. It also highlights any limitations of the study and suggests potential areas for future research.
